available operations:

sum:                                         "a+b = c"
substraction:                                "a-b = c"
product:                                     "a*b = c"
division:                                    "a/b = c"
mod division:                                "a%b = c"
raising to the power:                        "a^b = c"
calculating factorial of a positive integer:  "a! = b"

available functions:

raising to the power via function:   "pow(a,b) = c"
calculating square root of a number:  "sqrt(a) = b"
calculating sine:                      "sin(a) = c"
calculating cosine:                    "cos(a) = b"
calculating logarithm: a-base, b-val "log(a,b) = c"

to declare a variable use "#a = value"
